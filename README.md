# cl-project-manager

This program is a warm up to get me back into Common Lisp before working on some additional projects.  Subsequently, I assume it will evolve alongside those projects.

Its purpose will be to provide an interactive lisp program to provide default sensible project structure aimed to reduce my cognitive load as much as possible.  It should provide some basic form of automated (or at least highly assisted) project builds, testing, namespace management, integration with git version control and quick-lisp accessible cl libraries.

The first version of this project will be completed when cl-project-manager is able to set itself up as a proper assisted project managed by itself.

Future work may involve refactoring, asdf integration, and investigating whether this package itself could be loaded via quicklisp.
